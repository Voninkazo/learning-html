                When we are writing code in HTML, there are many rules that we have to follow properly. These are some
                examples:
                <p>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Define a doctype at the top of an HTML document.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can't have an end tag without a start tag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every start tag needs to start with a &#60; and end with a &#62;.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every end tag must start with a &#60;&#47; and end with a &#62;.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use lower case instead of uper case for the element name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Commas are not acceptable inside of tags.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have a nice indenting to make your code easy to read, do not start an element iside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nest your elements properly. If you want more explanation about the nesting rules, please go to
