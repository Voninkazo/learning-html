      <p>
        When we are writing code with HTML, there are many rules that we have to follow properly. These are some
        examples:
        <p>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you create an HTML document, you need to use an <strong>.html</strong> extension for your filename.
          <li>
            Define a doctype (<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>)at the top of an HTML document.
          </li>
          <li>
            An HTML document must have a head which contains the current document like a title, and a body that consists all of your main content.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can't have an end tag without a start tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tags are always surrounded by angle brackets (less-than &#60;/greater-than &#62; characters). For example: <br>
            <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
            Learning HTML 
            <code>&lt;/title&gt;</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            The second tag (the ending tag) always starts with a forward slash (/).
          </li>
          <li>
            When you start an tag within another tag, you have to close that inner tag before closing the outer tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            In some cases, tags have an optional <em>attributes</em> that use <em>values</em> to modify the tag's purpose.<br>
            <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use lower case instead of uper case for the element name.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commas are not acceptable inside of tags.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have a nice indenting to make your code easy to read, do not start an element iside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nest your elements properly. If you want more explanation about the nesting rules, please go to
            this page:<br>

              Learn how to nest elements
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Pay attention when writing an attribute name, the page below elaborates on the attribute
            rules:<br>
            <a href="attribute-rules.html">
              See more about attribute rules
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            For high-quality code, do test your html in the
            <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea">
              data validator
            </a>
            , and you will see what is wrong with your code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make your indenting spaces into 2, because 4 spaces may create conflicts when you push your work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not keep everything that is totally unecessary, you can do that by questioning everything.
          </li>
          <li>
            Validate your code and use markup according to its purpose.
          </li>
        </ul>
