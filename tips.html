        HTML is a first language that developers learn. As a web developer, speed is useful because it saves our time.
        These are tips that can help you to improve your speed:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a template that you can copy code from, that will decrease your typing task and save time as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to remember <em>all</em> of the HTML elements and what they are used for so that you will not struggle
            to use them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not use your mouse very often, use your keybord instead. At first it may be hard for you, but you will be
            an expert when you get used to it.

          <u>What tools shoud we use</u>
        </h3>

      <p>
        There are some tools that we can help you code faster.
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you are writing a whole bench of html, use an
            <strong>emmet</strong>. This is a tool that will save you lots of typing and will greatly improve your HTML,
            avoid writing the same thing every time as well. For
            example when you want to list of links, this is a very quick way to do that:<br>
            Type <b>nav>ul>li*3>a</b> then click <kbd>Enter</kbd>
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to use
            <a href="http://www.html-kit.com/docs/tools/menu/shortcuts/">
              keyboard shortcuts
            </a>
            very often. This is much faster than using the mouse.

        It is understandable that after writing a lot of code we feel exhausted, but finding time to check our work is
        very important. So here are some methods that can help you to deal with that:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>
              Open your code with browser
            </h4>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Follow these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Save your file with .html extension. If you don't do this, your file will not be read in the browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go to the file location, right clik on that file <b>>open with></b> and then select the browser of your
            choice.
          </li>
          <li>
            And you can keep it open while you are writing code in your .html file and whenever you want to see the
            changes in your browser, just refresh the page.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>
              Test your code in the data validator page
            </h4>
            The data validator checks the markup validity.
          </li>
        </ul>
