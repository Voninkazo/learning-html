          <u>What helps you to write HTML quicker</u>

      <p>
        HTML is a first language that developers learn. As a web developer, speed is useful because it saves our time.
        These are tips that can help you to improve your speed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a template that you can copy code from, that will decrease your typing task and save time as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to remember <em>all</em> of the HTML elements and what they are used for so that you will not struggle
          to use them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not use your mouse very often, use your keybord instead. At first it may be hard for you, but you will be
          an expert when you get used to it.

          <u>What tools should we use</u>
        </h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        There are some tools that we can help you code faster.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you are writing a whole bench of html, use an
          <strong>emmet</strong>. This is a tool that will save you lots of typing and will greatly improve your HTML,
          avoid writing the same thing every time as well. For
          example when you want to list of links, this is a very quick way to do that:<br>
          Type <b>nav>ul>li*3>a</b> then click <kbd>Enter</kbd>
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to use
          <a href="http://www.html-kit.com/docs/tools/menu/shortcuts/">
            keyboard shortcuts
          </a>
          very often. This is much faster than using the mouse.

        It is understandable that after writing a lot of code we feel exhausted, but finding time to check our work is
        very important. So, here are some methods that can help you to deal with that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>
            Open your code with browser
          </h4>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Follow these steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Save your file with .html extension. If you don't do this, your file will not be read in the browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to the file location, right clik on that file <b>>open with></b> and then select the browser of your
          choice.
        </li>
        <li>
          And you can keep it open while you are writing code in your .html file and whenever you want to see the
          changes in your browser, just refresh the page.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>
            Test your code in the data validator page
          </h4>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is efficient to always pass your code to the data validator as it checks the markup validity. These following
        steps will help you do that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First, make sure that your code is well-indented so that it will be much easier for you to correct the
          mistakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select your document in your .html file, then click CTRL+C to copy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to the
          <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea">
            data validator page
          </a>
          , paste in the check field and then check. This will show you the errors and warnings that should be fixed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lastly, make a bookmark of the page if you want, because you may need it in all your work.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>
            Make a pull request
          </h4>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Making pull requests helps you see what is wrong with your code. How can you do that?
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Once you've committed your work, push then open it in your github page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then make a new pull request that wil be assinged to your colleage or your team. In your pull request, write a
          good title with a very respectful message asking them to review your work.
        </li>
        <li>
          And if you have got something to work on, go back to your terminal and fix the mistakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to use those methods until you are satisfied with your work.
        </li>
      </ol>
